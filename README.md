# MoodRecognition

The purpose of this project is to create a set of R scripts (yes! you can name it 'a framework!') to process MP3 files in feature vectors, create Universal Background Model and use it to build machine learning system for music mood recognition.

The work will start about June, right after my other project is finished... so stay tuned!
